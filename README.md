# Router-1X3
As part of a professional VLSI training course at Maven Silicon, a leading VLSI training institute in Bengaluru, I designed, implemented, and verified a 1x3 Router project, a key hands-on module to develop expertise in VLSI Physical Design and Verification. This project involved creating a digital hardware module that routes data packets from a single input port to one of three output ports based on destination address, simulating a simplified Network-on-Chip (NoC) router. Completed under Maven Silicon’s industry-aligned curriculum, the project spanned multiple VLSI domains—RTL design, functional verification, synthesis, and physical design—using industry-standard EDA tools like Synopsys and Cadence. It provided practical exposure to real-world chip design workflows, from concept to sign-off, preparing me for roles in ASIC design and verification.
